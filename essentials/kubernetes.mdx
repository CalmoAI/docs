# Kubernetes Integration

Connect Calmo to your Kubernetes clusters to enable comprehensive container orchestration, monitoring, and troubleshooting through AI assistance. This integration provides access to 15+ specialized tools across 5 categories for complete cluster management.

## Overview & Value Proposition

The Kubernetes integration transforms how your team manages containerized applications by providing:

- **Cluster-Wide Visibility** - Monitor pods, services, deployments, and resources across namespaces
- **Intelligent Troubleshooting** - AI-powered analysis of pod failures, resource constraints, and configuration issues
- **Safe Operations** - Read-only tools enabled by default with granular control over write operations
- **Multi-Cloud Support** - Works with GKE, EKS, AKS, and self-managed clusters
- **Context-Aware Management** - Switch between clusters and namespaces seamlessly

## Key Capabilities

When connected, Calmo gains access to **15+ Kubernetes tools** across **5 categories**:

| Category | Tools | Capability |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Resource Management** | 5 tools | Get, list, describe, apply, and create Kubernetes resources |
| **Operations** | 4 tools | View logs, scale deployments, patch resources, manage rollouts |
| **Cluster Management** | 3 tools | Switch contexts, list API resources, explain resource types |
| **Advanced Operations** | 3 tools | Port forwarding, resource deletion, generic kubectl commands |
| **Helm Operations** | 3 tools | Install, upgrade, and uninstall Helm charts |

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes cluster access (GKE, EKS, AKS, or self-managed)
- Valid kubeconfig file with appropriate permissions
- For cloud providers: Service account keys (optional but recommended)
- Calmo account with team or personal workspace

## Setup Methods

### Method 1: Kubeconfig Upload (Recommended)

**Step 1: Prepare Your Kubeconfig**

1. Locate your kubeconfig file (typically `~/.kube/config`)
2. Ensure it contains valid cluster credentials and contexts
3. Verify access by running: `kubectl cluster-info`

**Step 2: Connect to Calmo**

![Kubernetes Integration Setup](../images/kubernetes-integration-setup.gif)

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in your Calmo dashboard
2. Click **Kubernetes** integration
3. Choose **Upload Kubeconfig File**
4. Select your kubeconfig file or paste the contents
5. Select your desired **context** from available options
6. Choose target **namespace** (default: `default`)

### Method 2: Cloud Provider Service Account (Enhanced Security)

For enhanced security with cloud providers, you can supplement kubeconfig with service account keys:

#### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

1. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console
2. Assign appropriate Kubernetes permissions
3. Download the service account key (JSON)
4. Upload both kubeconfig and service account key to Calmo

#### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

1. Configure AWS IAM role with EKS permissions
2. Update kubeconfig with AWS authentication
3. Provide AWS credentials through service account key

#### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

1. Create Azure service principal
2. Assign Kubernetes permissions
3. Configure kubeconfig with Azure authentication

*Use Cases: Resource discovery, status checking, configuration analysis*

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operations (Mixed Safety)
**Default: Logs only** - Operational tasks with varying risk levels

- **kubectl_logs** - View container logs (‚úÖ Read-only)
- **kubectl_scale** - Scale deployments (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)
- **kubectl_patch** - Patch resource configurations (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)
- **kubectl_rollout** - Manage deployment rollouts (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)

*Use Cases: Debugging applications, scaling services, deployment management*

### üóÇÔ∏è Cluster Management (Read-Safe)
**Default: Enabled** - Essential cluster navigation

- **kubectl_context** - Switch between cluster contexts
- **list_api_resources** - Discover available Kubernetes APIs
- **explain_resource** - Get resource documentation and schemas

*Use Cases: Multi-cluster management, API discovery, resource understanding*

### üîß Advanced Operations (High Risk)
**Default: Disabled** - Powerful but potentially dangerous operations

- **port_forward** - Forward local ports to pods (‚ö†Ô∏è Network access)
- **kubectl_delete** - Delete Kubernetes resources (‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive)
- **kubectl_generic** - Execute arbitrary kubectl commands (‚ö†Ô∏è Unrestricted)

*Use Cases: Advanced debugging, direct cluster access, emergency operations*

### üì¶ Helm Operations (Package Management)
**Default: Disabled** - Helm chart lifecycle management

- **install_helm_chart** - Install Helm charts (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)
- **upgrade_helm_chart** - Upgrade existing releases (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)  
- **uninstall_helm_chart** - Remove Helm releases (‚ö†Ô∏è Destructive)

*Use Cases: Application deployment, package management, release lifecycle*

## Team vs Personal Configuration

### Team/Organization Setup
- Shared cluster access across team members
- Centralized tool configuration and policies
- Organization-level context and namespace defaults
- Team administrators can manage tool permissions

### Personal Setup  
- Individual cluster connections
- Personal tool preferences and configurations
- Private contexts and namespace selections
- Full control over enabled capabilities

## Security & Best Practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Recommendations

1. **Start with Read-Only** - Enable only read operations initially
2. **Gradual Enablement** - Add write operations as trust builds
3. **Namespace Isolation** - Restrict to specific namespaces when possible
4. **Regular Auditing** - Review enabled tools and permissions periodically
5. **Service Account Keys** - Use cloud provider service accounts for enhanced security

### üîí Permission Levels

| Risk Level | Operations | Recommendation |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Low** | Get, List, Describe, Logs | ‚úÖ Safe to enable |
| **Medium** | Apply, Create, Scale, Patch | ‚ö†Ô∏è Enable with caution |
| **High** | Delete, Generic commands | ‚ùå Enable only when necessary |

## Configuration Management
## Configure Tool Access**

Review and customize tool categories based on your needs:

- ‚úÖ **Resource Management** - Read operations (get, list, describe) enabled by default
- ‚ùå **Write Operations** - Apply, create, delete disabled by default for safety
- ‚úÖ **Cluster Management** - Context switching and resource discovery enabled
- ‚ùå **Advanced Operations** - Port forwarding and generic commands disabled by default


## Tool Categories & Configuration

### üîç Resource Management (Read-Safe)
**Default: Enabled** - Essential for cluster visibility

- **kubectl_get** - Retrieve specific Kubernetes resources
- **kubectl_list** - List resources by type across namespaces  
- **kubectl_describe** - Get detailed resource information
- **kubectl_apply** - Apply configuration changes (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)
- **kubectl_create** - Create new resources (‚ö†Ô∏è Write operation)

### Updating Cluster Configuration

1. Navigate to **Integrations** ‚Üí **Kubernetes**
2. Click **Edit Configuration**
3. Upload new kubeconfig or service account keys
4. Modify context and namespace selections
5. Adjust tool permissions as needed
6. Save changes
