## Key Capabilities

When connected, Calmo gains access to **3 S3 tools** across **2 categories**:

| Category | Tools | Capability |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Buckets** | 1 tool | List all S3 buckets with metadata |
| **Objects** | 2 tools | List and retrieve objects from buckets |

## Prerequisites

- S3-compatible storage service (AWS S3, MinIO, etc.)
- Access credentials with appropriate permissions
- Network access to the S3 endpoint
- Calmo account with team or personal workspace

## Setup Process

### Step 1: Prepare S3 Access

**Gather Required Information:**
1. **Endpoint URL**: Your S3 service endpoint
   - AWS S3: `https://s3.amazonaws.com` or regional endpoint
   - MinIO: `https://your-minio-instance.com`
   - Other S3-compatible: Custom endpoint URL
2. **Access Key**: S3 access key ID
3. **Secret Key**: S3 secret access key
4. **Region** (optional): Target region for operations
5. **Buckets** (optional): Comma-separated list of specific buckets to access

### Step 2: Configure Access Permissions

**AWS S3 - IAM Policy Example:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:GetObjectMetadata"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*",
                "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**MinIO - Policy Example:**
```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
                "s3:ListBucket",
                "s3:GetObject"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

**Required Permissions:**
- `s3:ListAllMyBuckets` - List all accessible buckets
- `s3:ListBucket` - List objects within buckets
- `s3:GetObject` - Retrieve object content and metadata

### Step 3: Connect to Calmo

1. Navigate to **Integrations** in your Calmo dashboard
2. Click **S3** integration
3. Enter your connection details:
   - **S3 Endpoint**: Your S3 service endpoint URL
   - **Access Key**: Your S3 access key ID
   - **Secret Key**: Your S3 secret access key
   - **Region** (optional): Target region for operations
   - **Buckets** (optional): Specific buckets to restrict access to
4. Configure tool permissions:
   - ‚úÖ **All operations are read-only** by design
   - ‚úÖ **All tools enabled by default** for comprehensive storage access
5. Test the connection using the built-in connection test
6. Complete the integration setup

## Tool Categories & Configuration

### **Buckets** (Safe)
**Default: Enabled** - Essential for bucket discovery and management

- **list-s3-buckets** - List all S3 buckets with metadata including creation date and location

*Use Cases: Bucket inventory, storage organization, capacity planning, access validation*

### **Objects** (Safe)
**Default: Enabled** - Object discovery and retrieval operations

- **list-s3-objects** - List objects in a bucket with metadata including size, modified date, and storage class
- **get-s3-object** - Retrieve an object from a bucket including content and metadata

*Use Cases: Data discovery, file management, content analysis, backup verification*

## Team vs Personal Configuration

### Team/Organization Setup
