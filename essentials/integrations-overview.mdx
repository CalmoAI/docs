## Security & Safety First

### 🔒 Graduated Access Model

**Default Configuration:**
- ✅ **Read-only tools enabled** - Safe discovery and analysis capabilities
- ❌ **Write operations disabled** - Require explicit enablement for safety
- 🔧 **Granular control** - Enable specific tools based on team needs

**Permission Levels:**
- **Low Risk** - Read operations, discovery, analysis (Always safe to enable)
- **Medium Risk** - Limited write operations, updates (Enable with review)
- **High Risk** - Destructive operations, configuration changes (Enable only when necessary)

### 🛡️ Enterprise-Grade Controls

- **Team vs Personal Context** - Separate configurations for organization and individual use
- **Role-Based Access** - Different permission levels based on team roles
- **Audit Trail** - Complete logging of all AI-powered operations
- **Rollback Capabilities** - Safe experimentation with easy rollback options
