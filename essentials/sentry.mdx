## Security & Best Practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Recommendations

1. **Read-First Approach** - Begin with read-only operations, add write access as needed
2. **Scope Limitation** - Use minimal required scopes for auth tokens
3. **Token Rotation** - Regularly rotate auth tokens according to security policies
4. **Project Isolation** - Connect only necessary projects initially
5. **Team Permissions** - Leverage Sentry's built-in team and permission system

### üîí Permission Levels

| Risk Level | Operations | Recommendation |
|------------|------------|----------------|
| **Low** | List projects, read issues/events, view replays | ‚úÖ Safe to enable |
