   - **Important**: Copy the signing secret immediately (shown only once)

#### Step 3: Configure Signature Validation (Recommended)

1. Return to Calmo's **Webhook Management** section
2. Click **"Add Signing Secret"** next to your webhook
3. Paste the PagerDuty signing secret
4. Complete the validation wizard to verify security setup

##### How to Get Your PagerDuty Webhook Signing Secret

When setting up webhooks in PagerDuty, follow these steps to obtain your signing secret:

1. **Create a new webhook subscription** in your PagerDuty account
2. **During setup, PagerDuty will display a signing secret** - copy it immediately
3. **You won't be able to see it again** after leaving the page
4. **Paste the secret into Calmo** so we can verify incoming webhooks

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: If you didn't copy the secret during initial setup, you'll need to create a new webhook subscription to get a new secret.

#### Step 4: Test Integration

1. Use Calmo's **"Test Endpoint"** button for connectivity verification
2. Trigger a test incident in PagerDuty
3. Verify the issue appears in your Calmo dashboard
4. Confirm resolution workflows update correctly

### Security & Best Practices

#### Enterprise Security Features

- **HMAC-SHA256 Encryption**: Industry-standard cryptographic signature validation
- **Timing-Safe Comparison**: Protection against timing attack vulnerabilities  
- **Secure Secret Storage**: Encrypted webhook secrets with per-webhook isolation
- **Request Validation**: Comprehensive payload integrity verification

#### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Always Enable Signature Validation** - Ensures webhook authenticity and prevents spoofing
2. **Use Service Filters** - Reduce noise by targeting specific services
3. **Monitor Webhook Status** - Regular testing and status verification
4. **Secure Secret Management** - Treat signing secrets as sensitive credentials
5. **Test Thoroughly** - Validate complete incident lifecycle workflows

### Priority and Severity Mapping

PagerDuty incident priorities automatically map to appropriate Calmo severity levels:

| PagerDuty Priority | Calmo Severity | Visual Indicator |
|-------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **P1, P2, Critical, High** | Critical | Red alert indicators |
| **P3, Medium** | Warning | Yellow warning indicators |
| **P4, P5, Low, Info** | Info | Blue informational indicators |
| **Unknown/Unset** | Medium | Default yellow indicators |

This mapping ensures consistent incident classification and appropriate response prioritization across both systems.
